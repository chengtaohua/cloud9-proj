<h1>Improving Code Skills Outside of the Classroom</h1>

<p>As the market grows and technology evolves, the success as a programmer and developer depend upon the capacity of learning and improvement of certain skills. 
Building something yourself in a formal environment is not the only way to exercise your knowledge and force yourself to learn new things. There are some tools and techniques available to help your growth:
</p>

<section>
	<h2>Participate in Stack Overflow, forum, Blog Comments</h2>
			<p>As a beginner, there are many ways to develop programming skills and acquire some confidence creating your ow project in platforms such as dash and codecademy. Codaround for example, is a learning forum that brings a little bit of the touch of group learning to self-teaching. It was previously known as Hackavard and its focus is burgeoning community of coders through crowd of social tools and meetup services.</p>
			<p>Another great form to revise knowledge is by sharing it in platforms such as Stack Overflow. Most of the coding we do, if not exercised frequently can be lost in 3 months. By participating and answering other queries and commenting on Stack overflow, programmers and developers can revise some skills in order to help others.</p>
			<p>Reading good blogs can be similar of reading books, and it’s a great tool since information are usually broken into small pieces and it’s easier to digest. Those blogs are usually written by programmer and developers in which they share personal/professional point of views and experience in a specific project, it can become really relevant for a beginner.</p>

	<h2>Contribute to Open Source, sign-up for mailing lists, meetups</h2>
			<p>Analyse and work on other people’s code in open source platforms such as github. Reading through somebody else’s code or even forking the project and working on features to improve it are great ways to practice your skills, gain additional confidence and by posting it in your repo and opening a pull request you can get feedback from other developers and programmers. There are also Apache and Google open source projects to get involved too.</p>
			<p>Just by sign in a mailing list and getting involved in the discussions or news teach you a lot. The discussions are usually a really good way to understand a problem, the approach taken by other people, the solution found and the different/similar points of view which automatically develops good programming habits on you.</p>
			<p>Meetups are also a great tool to meet new programmers/developers and share experiences or even network to get involved in future projects. If you feel comfortable enough about a topic, give a speech/class in a meetup as a way to share it with other people. By sharing what you learned, you can reinforce it and also demonstrate your skills to future employers and clients.</p>

<section>
	<h2>Talk to fellow programmers</h2>
			<p>Seek out expert help, show your code and ask for feedback without fearing criticism. Don’t just do it all by yourself, talk and listen to other people’s perspective. Participating in events also helps.</p>
