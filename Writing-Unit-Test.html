<h1>G. Writing Unit Test:</h1>
<body>
<p>This method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together associated 
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. 
	<p>1. Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, 
  are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. Unit testing can be done manually, but is often 
  automated.</p>
  <p>2. Unit tests detect changes that may break the program design. Unit testing reduces defects in the newly developed 
  features or reduces bugs when changing the functionality, by verifying the accuracy of each unit. </p>
	<p>3. There are a number of automated unit testing tools - these include: xUnit.net; Unit; Unit; TestNG; PHPUnit; 
  Symphony Lime; Test Unit; RSpec. </p>
	<p>4. Planning the test process is recommended. It will help ensure that all aspects of a product are tested and covered. 
  Organizing the results allows for more efficient bug tracking; avoids duplicates; but does take time and resources to 
  develop.</p> 
	<p>5. Unit testing is performed by the software developer. A unit test is code that tests other code. Instead of running 
  the program, the developer runs the unit test code. The test code will report any problems.</p> 
	<p>6. Unit testing is based on testing the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in the system. A unit is 
  the smallest testable part of ay software that has one or more inputs and a single output.</p> 
	<p>7. The testing framework is an execution environment for automated tests. It is the overall system in which the tests 
  will be automated. It is defined as the set of assumptions, concepts, and practices it contains.</p> 
	<p>8. Unit testing is important because it is one of the earliest testing efforts performed on the code and the earlier 
  defects are detected, the easier they are to fix.</p> 
	<p>9. Unit testing will make the coding process more agile and efficient. It insures the quality of the code, catches bugs 
  early, facilitates changes, provides documentation and reduces costs.</p>
	<p>10.  A set of tests used to test an application are commonly called a test suite. It should be designed to achieve 
  coverage and clarity./p>
