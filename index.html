                <h2>Start here</h2>
                <p class="subtitle">Coding is indeed an essential part to a developer's job. But as a beginner, where should you start?</p>
            </section>
            <article>
                <p>Let's first figure out what programming languages are, and then pick one programming language we want to learn.</p>

                <h2>What are programming languages?</h2>
                <p>Computer programming languages allow users to give some instructions to their computers, make computers execute what they want, and finally solve problems using algorithms in computers. From "old-school" ones like COBOL and C++ to newer ones like Java and Python, there are more programming languages than we can count.</p>
                <p>There are also languages like HTML, CSS <small>(which are used to make the webpage you're looking at right now)</small> and SQL <small>(which is used to handle databases)</small> that some don't consider as "real" programming languages because of their lack of programming logic. Let's save these for later.</p>
                
                <h2>What is a good programming language for a beginner like you?</h2>
                <p><em>First and foremost, let's state the obvious: there is not an one-size-fits-all answer.</em></p>
                <p>As a beginner, you want to be careful on choosing your first programming language -- of course, if it is too difficult, you might lose your interest in coding altogether.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, you also want to consider how popular the language is -- it would be such a disappointment if, after all the time and effort, you end up realizing that no one wants to hire you!</p>

                <h2>Where to learn?</h2>
                <p>Taking college coding classes is certainly an option, but it might be still not be enough practicing for you. Plus, not everyone's schedule works with that of a brick-and-mortar institution...</p>
                <p>But there are some good options for you!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may have heard about <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, or even used the website. Here, you can learn multiple programming languages anywhere and anytime -- without installing anything on your computer.</li>
                    <li>Or, especially for web-programming, <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> could also be a good option.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> should also have some courses you can take.</li>

                <h2>How should you grow as a programmer?</h2>
                <p class="subtitle">...especially, outside of the classroom?</p>
            </section>
            <article>
                <p>As the market grows and technology evolves, the success as a programmer depends upon the capacity of learning and improvement of certain skills.</p>
                <p>Building something yourself in a formal environment (e.g. school) is not the only way to exercise your knowledge and force yourself to learn new things. There are tools and techniques available to help you!</p>

                <h2>Discuss</h2>
		    	<p>Though you may be a beginner, there are many ways for you to develop programming skills and acquire some confidence creating your own project in platforms.</p>
		    	<p><a href="https://codeground.in" target="_blank">CodeGround</a>, for example, is a learning forum that brings a little bit of the touch of group learning to self-teaching; it was previously known as Hackavard and its focus is burgeoning community of coders through crowd of social tools and meetup services. Another great form to refresh your programming knowledge is by sharing it in platforms such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
		    	<p>Remember that much of our coding skills, if not used and practiced frequently, can become rusty or even forgotten within just a few months months. By joining the conversation and helping others, you'll also be helping yourself.</p>
		    	
		    	<h2>Contribute</h2>
		    	<p>Read, analyze, and work on other people's codes in open source platforms such as <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This is a great way to practice your skills and gain additional confidence; and by posting it in your repository and opening a pull request, you can get feedback from other programmers. There are also Apache and Google open source projects to get involved too.</p>
		    	<p>Also, subscribe to a mailing list and getting involved in the discussions can teach you a lot. The discussions are usually an excellent way to compare, contrast and analyze how other people's codes approach specific issues -- this can help you hone your skills effectively.</p>
		    	
		    	<h2>Talk</h2>
		    	<p>Meetups can also be a great tool for meeting your fellow developers, sharing experiences, and even networking to get involved in future projects. If you feel confident enough about a topic, give a speech in a meetup as a way to share it with other people. By sharing what you've learned, you can reinforce it and also demonstrate your skills to potential future employers and clients.</p>
		    	<p>When you get stuck on something, don't be stuck on your own! Seek out expert help, show your code and ask for feedback without fearing criticism. Don't just do it all by yourself, talk about and listen to other people's perspectives -- that is the only way you can grow.</p>

                <h2>The road to mastery</h2>
                <p class="subtitle">Want to develop your skills further? Here are some key programming concepts that you should focus on.</p>
            </section>
            <article>
                <p>NOTE: In addition to a deep familiarity with all of these, it is equally important that you are proficient in those that are most appealing to your interests, relevant to the programming sector you would like to perform in, and in which you can realize a high level of competence and expertise.</p>
                
                <h2>Data structures</h2>
                <p><em>The format for the organization of data and management of the storage to allow sufficient access (retreival) and modification.</em></p>
                <p>The data structure is the collection of data values, the relationships between them and the functions or operations that can be applied to them. General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on. Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.</p>
                <p>See below for examples of two most common data structures, as implemented in JavaScript:</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/chengtaohua/def4ce33734dbd5d254016e979cdbb24.js"></script>
                
                <h2>Designing with object-oriented programming (OOP)</h2>
                <p><em>The process of planning a system of interaction objects for the purpose of solving a software problem.</em></p>
                <p>It entails the application of software design rules to the data and logic of objects during the development life cycle of the software. Object Oriented Programming provides the programmer with natural way to divide an application into small reusable pieces, called objects. At the same time, OOP provides an elegant way to construct applications in more efficient ways by building up from a collection of reusable components</p>
                
                <h2>Multi-threading</h2>
                <p><em>The ability of a central processing uint of a CPU to execute multiple processes or threads concurrently, supported by the operating system.</em></p>
                <p>This concurrent execution allows for more than one user at a time and even the management of multiple simultaneous requests by the same user. These threads share the process resources but are able to execute independently.</p>
                
                <h2>Recursion</h2>
                <p><em>A method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.</em></p>
                <p>It means defining a problem in terms of itself. Recursive algorithms break down problems into smaller pieces which are already known, or can be solved piecemeal, and then all in total.</p>
                <p>To give you an example, let's look at the following code in JavaScript:</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/chengtaohua/0f0e5ad8671a5b94889a50519673fa5b.js"></script>
                <p>This is a function that calculates a number's factorial. For instance, the factorial of 5 is 120, because 5*4*3*2*1=120. From this code, we can see that its recursive logic makes your computer do the calculations above.</p>
                
                <h2>Divide-and-conquer</h2>
                <p><em>An algorithm design paradigm based on a multi-branched recursion.</em></p>
                <p>A divide-and-conquer algorithm works recursively, breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related types until they become simple enough to be solved directly.</p>
                
                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <p><em>An early sample, model, or release of a product build to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or leaned from.</em></p>
                
                <h2>Unit test</h2>
                <p><em>Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. Unit testing can be done manually, but is often automated.</em>
                <p>Unit testing is based on testing the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in the system. A unit is the smallest testable part of ay software that has one or more inputs and a single output. A unit test is code that tests other code; Instead of running the program, the developer runs the unit test code, which is designed to report should any problems be found.</p>
                <p>There are a number of automated unit testing tools (e.g. xUnit.net, Unit, TestNG, PHPUnit, Symphony Lime, Test Unit, RSpec). The testing framework is an execution environment for automated tests. It is the overall system in which the tests will be automated. It is defined as the set of assumptions, concepts, and practices it contains.</p>
                <p>Unit tests detect changes that may break the program design. Unit testing reduces defects in the newly developed features or reduces bugs when changing the functionality, by verifying the accuracy of each unit. It is therefore important, for that it is one of the earliest testing efforts performed on the code -- and the earlier defects are detected, the easier they are to fix. </p>
                <p>Unit testing will make the coding process more agile and efficient. It insures the quality of the code, catches bugs early, facilitates changes, provides documentation and reduces costs.</p>
                <p>Planning the test process is recommended. It will help ensure that all aspects of a product are tested and covered. Organizing the results allows for more efficient bug tracking; avoids duplicates; but does take time and resources to develop.</p>
