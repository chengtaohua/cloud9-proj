    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
   <p>The most important programming concepts to focus upon in your skills development effort are the issues listed below. 
    It is essential to have a deep familiarity with all of these - and strong competence in those that are most appealing 
    to your interests, relevant to the programming sector you would like to perform in, and in which you can realize a high
    level of competence and expertise.</p>
    <p> 1. Data structures: the format for the organization of data and management of the storage  to allow sufficient 
    access (retreival) and modification. The data structure is the collection of data values, the relationships between 
    them and the functions or operations that can be applied to them. General data structure types include the array, 
    the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on. Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific
    purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.</p> 
   <p>2.	Designing w/Object Oriented Programming: the process of planning a system of interaction objects for the purpose
   of solving a software problem. It entails the application of software design rules to the data and logic of objects 
   during the development life cycle of the software. Object Oriented Programming provides the programmer with natural way
   to divide an application into small reusable pieces, called objects. At the same time, OOP provides an elegant way to 
   construct applications in more efficient ways by building up from a collection of reusable components.|</p>
   <p> 3.	Multi-threading: the ability of a central processing uint of a CPU to execute multiple processes or threads 
   concurrently, supported by the operating system. This concurrent execution allows for more than one user at a time and 
   even the management of multiple simultaneous requests by the same user. These thread share the process resources but are 
   able to execute independently. </p>
	 <p>4.	Programming concepts:</p>
	    <p>1.	Recursion: a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the 
      same problem. It means defining a problem in terms of itself. Recursive algorithms break down problems into smaller 
      pieces which are already known, or can be solved piecemeal, and then all in total.</p> 
	    <p>2.	Divide and Conquer: an algorithm design paradigm based on a multi-branched recursion. A divine and conquer 
      algorithm works recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related types until 
      these become simple enough to be solved directly.</p> 
	    <p>3.	Prototype: an early sample, model, or release of a product build to test a concept or process or to act as a 
      thing to be replicated or leaned from.</p>
